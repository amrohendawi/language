# MiQA

This folder contains the dataset for the paper [MiQA: A Benchmark for Inference on Metaphorical Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07993).

## Data Format

The dataset is available in the data/ directory in TSV (Tab-separated) format.
The columns are: literal_premise, metaphorical_premise, literal_conclusion,
metaphorical_conclusion.

## Usage

Two types of MiQA questions can be built using each row in the dataset.

1. If $M_p$, which of the following statements could that imply: $M_c$ or $L_c$?

2. $L_c$ is implied by which of the following: $M_p$ or $L_p$?

Here are some examples:

| "_implies_"-questions                               | "_implied-by_"-questions                         |
